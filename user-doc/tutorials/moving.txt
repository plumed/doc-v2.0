\page moving Moving from Plumed 1 to Plumed 2

Syntax in PLUMED 2 has been completely redesigned. The main difference is that
whereas in PLUMED 1 lines could be inserted in any order, 
in PLUMED 2 the order of the lines matters. This is due to a major change in 
the internal architecture of PLUMED. In version 2, commands (or "actions") are
executed in the order they are found in the input file.
Because of this, you must e.g. first compute a collective variable and then print it
later. More information can be found in the Section about \ref Syntax.

Another very important change is in the way groups are used, discussed below.
Finally, many features appear under a different name in the new version.

\section moving-Groups Groups

In Plumed 1 groups (lists) were used for two tasks:
- To provide centers of masses to collective variables such as distances, angles, etc. This is 
  now done by defining virtual atoms using either \ref CENTER or \ref COM
- To provide lists of atoms to collective variables such as coordination, gyration radius, etc.
  This is now done directly in the line that defines the collective variable. 

If you would still like to use groups you can use the \ref GROUP commands.  Whenever the label
for a \ref GROUP action appears in the input it is replaced by the list of atoms that were 
specified in the \ref GROUP.

\section moving-Directives Directives

What follows is a list of all the documented directives of Plumed 1 together with their 
plumed 2 equivalents.  Be aware that the input syntaxes for these directives are not totally 
equivalent.  You should read the documentation for the Plumed 2 Action.
