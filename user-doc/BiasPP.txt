\page Bias Bias

PLUMED allows you to run a number of enhanced sampling algorithms.
The list of enhanced sampling algorithms contained in PLUMED is as follows:

<table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  ABMD </td> <td>
Adds a ratchet-and-pawl like restraint on one or more variables.
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  BIASVALUE </td> <td>
Takes the value of one variable and use it as a bias
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  EXTERNAL </td> <td>
Calculate a restraint that is defined on a grid that is read during start up
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  LOWER_WALLS </td> <td>
The LOWER_WALLS and UPPER_WALLS keywords define a wall for the value of one or more collective variables,
 which limits the region of the phase space accessible during the simulation. 
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  METAD </td> <td>
Used to performed MetaDynamics on one or more collective variables.
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  MOVINGRESTRAINT </td> <td>
Add a time-dependent, harmonic restraint on one or more variables.
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  RESTRAINT </td> <td>
Adds harmonic and/or linear restraints on one or more variables.  
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  UPPER_WALLS </td> <td>
The LOWER_WALLS and UPPER_WALLS keywords define a wall for the value of one or more collective variables,
 which limits the region of the phase space accessible during the simulation. 
</td> </tr>
</table>

Methods, such as \ref METAD, that work by introducing a history dependent bias can be restarted
using the \subpage RESTART keyword

You can also use PLUMED in conjunction with VMD's interactive MD module by taking
advantage of the \subpage IMD action.
