PLUMED 2 is written and maintained by five core developers none of whom work full
time on the maintanence and upkeep of the code.  From our point of view it is thus 
desirable to keep the core of the code small.  In addition, we are very keen that 
users who contribute functionality to PLUMED get the plaudits that they deserve. 
For these reasons many of PLUMED's more advanced functionalities are provided in 
modules that users can download.  To download a module you simply change to the 
<c> plumed2/mymodules </c> directory and issue the following command:

\verbatim
./plumed-get-module.sh <name of module>
\endverbatim  

The following optional modules can be added to PLUMED 2:

\section addmodule Adding a module

If you have a PLUMED module that you would like us to advertise on the website
you should copy the directory structure from <c> plumed2/template-module </c> 
as well as all the files inside that directory and place your source and regtest
files in appropriate directories.  You are responsible for finding a suitable 
web repository to host the code that you have developed (we use http://www.assembla.com 
for PLUMED). You do not need to give us write access to your repository as ensuring that
your code keeps working with any new release of PLUMED is YOUR responsibility.

Once you are ready to release your code simply send any email to one of the developers
with a txt file that contains the following information in the following format:

\verbatim
NAME: <the name of your module>

AUTHOR: <the list of people involved in the development of the module>

REPOSITORY: <the command that retreives the code e.g. git clone git@git.assembla.com:plumed2.git>

DESCRIPTION:

<a short description of what it is your module calculates>
<citations and equations can be included using the usual doxygen commands>
\endverbatim
