Adds a ratchet-and-pawl like restraint on one or more variables.

This action can be used to evolve a system towards a target value in
CV space using an harmonic potential moving with the thermal fluctuations of the CV
\cite ballone \cite provasi10abmd \cite camilloni11abmd. The biasing potential in this 
method is as follows:

\f$
V(\rho(t)) = \left \{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{K}{2}\left(\rho(t)-\rho_m(t)\right)^2, &\rho(t)>\rho_m(t)\\
              0, & \rho(t)\le\rho_m(t), \end{array} \right .
\f$


where


\f$
\rho(t)=\left(CV(t)-TO\right)^2
\f$


and


\f$
\rho_m(t)=\min_{0\le\tau\le t}\rho(\tau)+\eta(t)
\f$.

The method is based on the introduction of a biasing potential which is zero when
the system is moving towards the desired arrival point and which damps the
fluctuations when the system attempts to move in the opposite direction. As in the
case of the ratchet and pawl system, propelled by thermal motion of the solvent
molecules, the biasing potential does not exert work on the system. \f$\eta(t)\f$ is
an additional white noise acting on the minimum position of the bias.

\par Examples
The following input sets up two biases, one on the distance between atoms 3 and 5
and another on the distance between atoms 2 and 4. The two target values are defined
using TO and the two strength using KAPPA. The total energy of the bias is printed.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
ABMD ARG=d1,d2 TO=1.0,1.5 KAPPA=5.0,5.0 LABEL=abmd
PRINT ARG=abmd.bias
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).
