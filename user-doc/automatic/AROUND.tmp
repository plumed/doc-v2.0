This quantity can be used to calculate functions of the distribution of collective 
variables for the atoms that lie in a particular, user-specified part of of the cell.

Each of the base quantities calculated by a multicolvar can can be assigned to a particular point in three 
dimensional space. For example, if we have the coordination numbers for all the atoms in the
system each coordination number can be assumed to lie on the position of the central atom. 
Because each base quantity can be assigned to a particular point in space we can calculate functions of the
distribution of base quantities in a particular part of the box by using:

\f[
\overline{s}_{\tau} = \frac{ \sum_i f(s_i) w(x_i,y_i,z_i) }{ \sum_i w(x_i,y_i,z_i) }  
\f]  

where the sum is over the collective variables, \f$s_i\f$, each of which can be thought to be at \f$ (x_i,y_i,z_i)\f$.
The function \f$ w(x_i,y_i,z_i) \f$ measures whether or not the system is in the subregion of interest. It
is equal to:

\f[
w(x_i,y_i,z_i) = \int_{xl}^{xu} \int_{yl}^{yu} \int_{zl}^{zu} \textrm{d}x\textrm{d}y\textrm{d}z K\left( \frac{x - x_i}{\sigma} \right)K\left( \frac{y - y_i}{\sigma} \right)K\left( \frac{z - z_i}{\sigma} \right) 
\f]

where \f$K\f$ is one of the kernel functions described on \ref histogrambead and \f$\sigma\f$ is a bandwidth parameter.
The function \f$(s_i)\f$ can be any of the usual LESS_THAN, MORE_THAN, WITHIN etc that are used in all other multicolvars.

When AROUND is used with the \ref DENSITY action the number of atoms in the specified region is calculated  

\par Examples

The following commands tell plumed to calculate the average coordination number for the atoms
that have x (in fractional coordinates) within 2.0 nm of the com of mass c1. The final value will be labeled s.mean.
