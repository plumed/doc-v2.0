/**
\page DUMPATOMS DUMPATOMS
Dump selected atoms on a file.

This command can be used to output the positions of a particular set of atoms.
The atoms required are ouput in a xyz or gro formatted file.
The type of file is automatically detected from the file extension, but can be also
enforced with TYPE.
Importantly, if your
input file contains actions that edit the atoms position (e.g. \ref WHOLEMOLECULES)
and the DUMPATOMS command appears after this instruction, then the edited
atom positions are output.
You can control the buffering of output using the \ref FLUSH keyword on a separate line.

Units of the printed file can be controlled with the UNITS keyword. By default PLUMED units as
controlled in the \ref UNITS command are used, but one can override it e.g. with UNITS=A.
Notice that gro files can only contain coordinates in nm.

\par Examples

The following input instructs plumed to print out the positions of atoms
1-10 together with the position of the center of mass of atoms 11-20 every
10 steps to a file called file.xyz.
\verbatim
COM ATOMS=11-20 LABEL=c1
DUMPATOMS STRIDE=10 FILE=file.xyz ATOMS=1-10,c1
\endverbatim
(see also \ref COM)

The following input is very similar but dumps a .gro (gromacs) file,
which also contains atom and residue names.
\verbatim
# this is required to have proper atom names:
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=reference.pdb
# if omitted, atoms will have "X" name...

COM ATOMS=11-20 LABEL=c1
DUMPATOMS STRIDE=10 FILE=file.gro ATOMS=1-10,c1
# notice that last atom is a virtual one and will not have
# a correct name in the resulting gro file
\endverbatim
(see also \ref COM and \ref MOLINFO)
