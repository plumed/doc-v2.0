<td> the input for this action is the output from one or more other actions. The particular output that you used is referenced using that action of interests label. If the label appears on its own then the value of the relevant Action is taken.  If * or *.* appears the information from all arguments is taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs, each component of the output has a specific label so for instance an action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.* </td>

\par Examples
The following is an input for a calculation with an external potential that is
defined in the file bias.dat and that acts on the distance between atoms 3 and 5.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
EXTERNAL ARG=d1 FILENAME=bias.dat LABEL=external
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE \ref PRINT).

The header in the file bias.dat should read:
\verbatim
#! FIELDS d1 external.bias der_d1
#! SET min_d1 0.0
#! SET max_d1 1.0
#! SET nbins_d1 100
#! SET periodic_d1 false
\endverbatim

This should then be followed by the value of the potential and its derivative
at 100 equally spaced points along the distance between 0 and 1. If you run
with NOSPLINE you do not need to provide derivative information.

You can also include grids that are a function of more than one collective
variable.  For instance the following would be the input for an external
potential acting on two torsional angles:
\verbatim
TORSION ATOMS=4,5,6,7 LABEL=t1
TORSION ATOMS=6,7,8,9 LABEL=t2
EXTERNAL ARG=t1,t2 FILENAME=bias.dat LABEL=ext
\endverbatim

The header in the file bias.dat for this calculation would read:
\verbatim
#! FIELDS t1 t2 ext.bias der_t1 der_t2
#! SET min_t1 -pi
#! SET max_t1 +pi
#! SET nbins_t1 100
#! SET periodic_t1 true
#! SET min_t2 -pi
#! SET max_t2 +pi
#! SET nbins_t2 100
#! SET periodic_t2 true
\endverbatim

This would be then followed by 100 blocks of data.  In the first block of data the
value of t1 (the value in the first column) is kept fixed and the value of
the function is given at 100 equally spaced values for t2 between \f$-pi\f$ and \f$+pi\f$.  In the
second block of data t1 is fixed at \f$-pi + \frac{2pi}{100}\f$ and the value of the function is
given at 100 equally spaced values for t2 between \f$-pi\f$ and \f$+pi\f$. In the third block of
data the same is done but t1 is fixed at \f$-pi + \frac{4pi}{100}\f$ and so on untill you get to
the 100th block of data where t1 is fixed at \f$+pi\f$.

Please note the order that the order of arguments in the plumed.dat file must be the same as
the order of arguments in the header of the grid file.
