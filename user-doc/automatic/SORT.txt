/**
\page SORT SORT
This function can be used to sort colvars according to their magnitudes.

\par Description of components

This function sorts its arguments according to their magnitudes. The largest argument will be
labelled <em>label</em>.1, the second largest will be labelled <em>label</em>.2 and so on.

\par Compulsory keywords

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ARG </b></td>
<td> the input for this action is the output from one or more other actions. The particular output that you used is referenced using that action of interests label. If the label appears on its own then the value of the relevant Action is taken.  If * or *.* appears the information from all arguments is taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs, each component of the output has a specific label so for instance an action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.* </td>

<td width=15%> <b> NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES </b></td>
<td> ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these quantities numerically </td>

\par Examples
The following input tells plumed to print the distance of the closest and of
the farthest atoms to atom 1, chosen among atoms from 2 to 5
\verbatim
d12:  DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
d13:  DISTANCE ATOMS=1,3
d14:  DISTANCE ATOMS=1,4
d15:  DISTANCE ATOMS=1,5
sort: SORT ARG=d12,d13,d14,d15
PRINT ARG=sort.1,sort.4
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT and \ref DISTANCE).
