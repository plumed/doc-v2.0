/**
\page RESTRAINT RESTRAINT
Adds harmonic and/or linear restraints on one or more variables.  

Either or both
of SLOPE and KAPPA must be present to specify the linear and harmonic force constants
respectively.  The resulting potential is given by: 
\f[
  \sum_i \frac{k_i}{2} (x_i-a_i)^2 + m_i*(x_i-a_i)
\f].

The number of components for any vector of force constants must be equal to the number
of arguments to the action.

\par Examples
The following input tells plumed to restrain the distance between atoms 3 and 5
and the distance between atoms 2 and 4, at different equilibrium
values, and to print the energy of the restraint
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
RESTRAINT ARG=d1,d2 AT=1.0,1.5 KAPPA=150.0,150.0 LABEL=restraint
PRINT ARG=restraint.bias
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).
