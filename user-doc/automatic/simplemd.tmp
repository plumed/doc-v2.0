simplemd allows one to do molecular dynamics on systems of Lennard-Jones atoms.

The input to simplemd is spcified in an input file. Configurations are input and
output in xyz format. The input file should contain one directive per line. 
The directives available are as follows:

\par Examples

You run an MD simulation using simplemd with the following command:
\verbatim
plumed simplemd < in
\endverbatim

The following is an example of an input file for a simplemd calculation. This file
instructs simplemd to do 50 steps of MD at a temperature of 0.722
\verbatim
nputfile input.xyz
outputfile output.xyz
temperature 0.722
tstep 0.005
friction 1
forcecutoff 2.5
listcutoff  3.0
nstep 50
nconfig 10 trajectory.xyz
nstat   10 energies.dat
\endverbatim

If you run the following a description of all the directives that can be used in the
input file will be output.
\verbatim
plumed simplemd --help
\endverbatim
