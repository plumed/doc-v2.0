/**
\page DIPOLE DIPOLE
Calcualte the dipole moment for a group of atoms.

\par The atoms involved can be specified using

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> GROUP </b></td>
<td> the group of atoms we are calculating the dipole moment for </td>
</tr>
</table>

\par Options

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES </b></td>
<td> ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these quantities numerically </td>
</tr>

</table>

</table>

\par Examples
The following tells plumed to calculate the dipole of the group of atoms containing
the atoms from 1-10 and print it every 5 steps
\verbatim
d: DIPOLE GROUP=1-10
PRINT FILE=output STRIDE=5 ARG=5
\endverbatim
(see also \ref PRINT)

\attention
If the total charge Q of the group in non zero, then a charge Q/N will be subtracted to every atom,
where N is the number of atoms. This implies that the dipole (which for a charged system depends
on the position) is computed on the geometric center of the group.
