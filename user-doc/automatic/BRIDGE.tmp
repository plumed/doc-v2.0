/**
\page BRIDGE BRIDGE
Calculate the number of atoms that bridge two parts of a structure

This quantity calculates:

\f[
 f(x) = \sum_{ijk} s_A(r_{ij})s_B(r_{ik})
\f] 

where the sum over \f$i\f$ is over all the ``bridging atoms" and 
\f$s_A\f$ and \f$s_B\f$ are \ref switchingfunction.

\par Examples

The following example instructs plumed to calculate the number of water molecules
that are bridging betweeen atoms 1-10 and atoms 11-20 and to print the value 
to a file

\verbatim
BRIDGE BRIDGING_ATOMS=100-200 GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=11-20 LABEL=w1
PRINT ARG=a1.mean FILE=colvar 
\endverbatim
