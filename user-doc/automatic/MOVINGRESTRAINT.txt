\page MOVINGRESTRAINT MOVINGRESTRAINT
Add a time-dependent, harmonic restraint on one or more variables.

This form of bias can be used to performed steered MD \cite Grubmuller3
and Jarzynski sampling \cite jarzynski.

The harmonic restraint on your system is given by:

\f[
V(\vec{s},t) = \frac{1}{2} \kappa(t) ( \vec{s} - \vec{s}_0(t) )^2
\f]

The time dependence of \f$\kappa\f$ and \f$\vec{s}_0\f$ are specified by a list of
STEP, KAPPA and AT keywords.  These keywords tell plumed what values \f$\kappa\f$ and \f$\vec{s}_0\f$
should have at the time specified by the corresponding STEP keyword.  Inbetween these times
the values of \f$\kappa\f$ and \f$\vec{s}_0\f$ are linearly interpolated.

\par Description of components

By default this Action calculates the following quantities. These quanties can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr> <td width=5%> <b> Quantity </b> </td> <td> <b> Description </b> </td> </tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> bias </b></td>
<td> the instantaneous value of the bias potential </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> force2 </b></td>
<td> the instantaneous value of the squared force due to this bias potential </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> _cntr </b></td>
<td> one or multiple instances of this quantity will be refereceable elsewhere in the input file. these quantities will named with  the arguments of the bias followed by the character string _cntr. These quantities give the instantaneous position of the center of the harmonic potential. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> _work </b></td>
<td> one or multiple instances of this quantity will be refereceable elsewhere in the input file. These quantities will named with the arguments of the bias followed by the character string _work. These quantities tell the user how much work has been done by the potential in dragging the system along the various colvar axis. </td>

\par Compulsory keywords

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ARG </b></td>
<td> the input for this action is the output from one or more other actions. The particular output that you used is referenced using that action of interests label. If the label appears on its own then the value of the relevant Action is taken.  If * or *.* appears the information from all arguments is taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs, each component of the output has a specific label so for instance an action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.* </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> VERSE </b></td>
<td> ( default=B ) Tells plumed whether the restraint is only acting for CV larger (U) or smaller (L) than the restraint or whether it is acting on both sides (B) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> STEP </b></td>
<td> This keyword appears multiple times as STEPx with x=0,1,2,...,n.  Each value given represents the MD step at which the restraint parameters take the values KAPPAx and ATx. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. STEP1, STEP2, STEP3... </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> AT </b></td>
<td> ATx is equal to the position of the restraint at time STEPx.  For intermediate times this parameter is linearly interpolated.  If no ATx is specified for STEPx then the values of AT are kept constant during the interval of time between STEPx-1 and STEPx. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. AT1, AT2, AT3... </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> KAPPA </b></td>
<td> KAPPAx is equal to the value of the force constants at time STEPx.  For intermediate times this parameter is linearly interpolated.  If no KAPPAx is specified for STEPx then the values of KAPPAx are kept constant during the interval of time between STEPx-1 and STEPx. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. KAPPA1, KAPPA2, KAPPA3... </td>

\par Examples
The following input is dragging the distance between atoms 2 and 4
from 1 to 2 in the first 1000 steps, then back in the next 1000 steps.
In the following 500 steps the restraint is progressively switched off.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d
MOVINGRESTRAINT ...
ARG=d
STEP0=0    AT0=1.0 KAPPA0=100.0
STEP1=1000 AT1=2.0
STEP2=2000 AT2=1.0
STEP3=2500         KAPPA3=0.0
... MOVINGRESTRAINT
\endverbatim
The following input is progressively building restraints
distances between atoms 1 and 5 and between atoms 2 and 4
in the first 1000 steps. Afterwards, the restraint is kept
static.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=1,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
MOVINGRESTRAINT ...
ARG=d1,d2
STEP0=0    AT0=1.0,1.5 KAPPA0=0.0,0.0
STEP1=1000 AT1=1.0,1.5 KAPPA1=1.0,1.0
... MOVINGRESTRAINT
\endverbatim
The following input is progressively bringing atoms 1 and 2
close to each other with an upper wall
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2 LABEL=d1
MOVINGRESTRAINT ...
ARG=d1
VERSE=U
STEP0=0    AT0=1.0 KAPPA0=10.0
STEP1=1000 AT1=0.0
... MOVINGRESTRAINT
\endverbatim

By default the Action is issuing some values which are
the work on each degree of freedom, the center of the harmonic potential,
the total bias deposited

(See also \ref DISTANCE).

\attention Work is not computed properly when KAPPA is time dependent.
