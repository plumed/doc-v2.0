/**
\page GHOST GHOST
Calculate the absolute position of a ghost atom with fixed coordinates
in the local reference frame formed by three atoms. 
The computed ghost atom is stored as a virtual atom that can be accessed in
an atom list through the the label for the GHOST action that creates it.

\par Examples
The following input instructs plumed to print the distance between the
ghost atom and the center of mass for atoms 15,20:
\verbatim
GHOST ATOMS=1,5,10 COORDINATES=10.0,10.0,10.0 LABEL=c1
COM ATOMS=15,20       LABEL=c2
DISTANCE ATOMS=c1,c2  LABEL=d1
PRINT ARG=d1
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).
