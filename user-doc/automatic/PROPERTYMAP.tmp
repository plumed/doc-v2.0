\page PROPERTYMAP PROPERTYMAP
Calculate generic property maps.

This Colvar calculates the property maps according to the work of Spiwok \cite Spiwok:2011ce.


Basically it calculates
\f{eqnarray}
X=\frac{\sum_i X_i*\exp(-\lambda D_i(x))}{\sum_i  \exp(-\lambda D_i(x))} \\
Y=\frac{\sum_i Y_i*\exp(-\lambda D_i(x))}{\sum_i  \exp(-\lambda D_i(x))} \\
\cdots\\
zzz=-\frac{1}{\lambda}\log(\sum_i  \exp(-\lambda D_i(x)))
\f}

where the parameters \f$X_i\f$  and  \f$Y_i\f$ are provided in the input pdb (allv.pdb in this case) and  
 \f$D_i(x)\f$  is the MSD after optimal alignment calculated on the pdb frames you input (see Kearsley).

\par Examples
\verbatim
p3: PROPERTYMAP REFERENCE=../../trajectories/path_msd/allv.pdb PROPERTY=X,Y LAMBDA=69087 NEIGH_SIZE=8 NEIGH_STRIDE=4
PRINT ARG=p3.X,p3.Y,p3.zzz STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar FMT=%8.4f
\endverbatim

note that NEIGH_STRIDE=4 NEIGH_SIZE=8 control the neighborlist parameter (optional but
recommended for performance) and states that the neighbor list will be calculated every 4
timesteps and consider only the closest 8 member to the actual md snapshots.

In this case the input line instructs plumed to look for two properties X and Y with attached values in the REMARK 
line of the reference pdb (Note: No spaces from X and = and 1 !!!!).
e.g.

\verbatim
REMARK X=1 Y=2 
ATOM      1  CL  ALA     1      -3.171   0.295   2.045  1.00  1.00
ATOM      5  CLP ALA     1      -1.819  -0.143   1.679  1.00  1.00
.......
END
REMARK X=2 Y=3 
ATOM      1  CL  ALA     1      -3.175   0.365   2.024  1.00  1.00
ATOM      5  CLP ALA     1      -1.814  -0.106   1.685  1.00  1.00
....
END
\endverbatim

\note
The implementation of this collective variable and of \ref PATHMSD
is shared, as well as most input options.
