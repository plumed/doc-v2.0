Calculate the distances between a number of pairs of atoms and transform each distance by a switching function.

\par Examples

The following example calculates switching functions based on the distances between atoms
1 and 2, 3 and 4 and 4 and 5. The values of these three switching functions are then output
to a file named colvar.

\verbatim
CONTACTMAP ATOMS1=1,2 ATOMS2=3,4 ATOMS3=4,5 ATOMS4=5,6 SWITCH=(RATIONAL R_0=1.5) LABEL=f1
PRINT ARG=f1.* FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT)
