Probe the alpha helical content of a protein structure.

Any chain of six contiguous residues in a protein chain can form an alpha helix. This
colvar thus generates the set of all possible six residue sections and calculates
the RMSD distance between the configuration in which the residues find themselves
and an idealized alpha helical structure. These distances can be calculated by either 
aligning the instantaneous structure with the reference structure and measuring each
atomic displacement or by calculating differences between the set of interatomic
distances in the reference and instantaneous structures. 

This colvar is based on the following reference \cite pietrucci09jctc.  The authors of 
this paper use the set of distances from the alpha helix configurations to measure 
the number of segments that have an alpha helical configuration. This is done by calculating
the following sum of functions of the rmsd distances:

\f[
s = \sum_i \frac{ 1 - \left(\frac{r_i-d_0}{r_0}\right)^n } { 1 - \left(\frac{r_i-d_0}{r_0}\right)^m }
\f]

where the sum runs over all possible segments of alpha helix.  By default the 
NN, MM and D_0 parameters are set equal to those used in \cite pietrucci09jctc.  The R_0
parameter must be set by the user - the value used in \cite pietrucci09jctc was 0.08 nm.

If you change the function in the above sum you can calculate quantities such as the average
distance from a purely the alpha helical configuration or the distance between the set of 
residues that is closest to an alpha helix and the reference configuration. To do these sorts of 
calculations you can use the AVERAGE and MIN keywords. In addition you can use the LESS_THAN
keyword if you would like to change the form of the switching function. If you use any of these
options you no longer need to specify NN, R_0, MM and D_0.   

Please be aware that for codes like gromacs you must ensure that plumed 
reconstructs the chains involved in your CV when you calculate this CV using
anthing other than TYPE=DRMSD.  For more details as to how to do this see \ref WHOLEMOLECULES.

\par Examples

The following input calculates the number of six residue segments of 
protein that are in an alpha helical configuration.
