/**
\page COMBINE COMBINE
Calculate a polynomial combination of a set of other variables.

The functional form of this function is
\f[
C=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{arg}} c_i x_i^{p_i}
\f]

The coefficients c and powers p are provided as vectors.



\par Examples
The following input tells plumed to print the distance between atoms 3 and 5
its square (as computed from the x,y,z components) and the distance
again as computed from the square root of the square.
\verbatim
DISTANCE LABEL=dist      ATOMS=3,5 COMPONENTS
COMBINE  LABEL=distance2 ARG=dist.x,dist.y,dist.z POWERS=2,2,2 PERIODIC=NO
COMBINE  LABEL=distance  ARG=distance2 POWERS=0.5 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=distance,distance2
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT and \ref DISTANCE).
