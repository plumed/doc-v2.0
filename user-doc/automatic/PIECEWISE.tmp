/**
\page PIECEWISE PIECEWISE
Compute a piecewise straight line through its arguments that passes through
a set of ordered control points. 

For variables less than the first
(greater than the last) point, the value of the first (last) point is used.

\f[
\frac{y_{i+1}-y_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i}(s-x_i)+y_i ;  if x_i<s<x_{i+1}
\f]
\f[
y_N ; if x>x_{N-1} 
\f]
\f[
y_1 ; if x<x_0 
\f]

Control points are passed using the POINT0=... POINT1=... syntax as in the example below

If one argument is supplied, it results in a scalar quantity.
If multiple arguments are supplied, it results
in a vector of arguments.

\par Examples
\verbatim
dist1: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,10
dist2: DISTANCE ATOMS=2,11

pw: PIECEWISE POINT0=1,10 POINT1=1,PI POINT2=3,10 ARG=dist1
ppww: PIECEWISE POINT0=1,10 POINT1=1,PI POINT2=3,10 ARG=dist1,dist2
PRINT ARG=pw,ppww.1,ppww.2
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT and \ref DISTANCE).
