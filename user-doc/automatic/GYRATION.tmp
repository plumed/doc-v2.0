\page GYRATION GYRATION
Calculate the radius of gyration, or other properties related to it.

The different properties can be calculated and selected by the TYPE keyword:
the Radius of Gyration (RADIUS); the Trace of the Gyration Tensor (TRACE); 
the Largest Principal Moment of the Gyration Tensor (GTPC_1); the middle Principal Moment of the Gyration Tensor (GTPC_2);
the Smallest Principal Moment of the Gyration Tensor (GTPC_3); the Asphericiry (ASPHERICITY); the Acylindricity (ACYLINDRICITY);
the Relative Shape Anisotropy (KAPPA2); the Smallest Principal Radius Of Gyration (GYRATION_3); 
the Middle Principal Radius of Gyration (GYRATION_2); the Largest Principal Radius of Gyration (GYRATION_1).
A derivation of all these different variants can be found in \cite Vymetal:2011gv

The radius of gyration is calculated using:

\f[
s_{\rm Gyr}=\Big ( \frac{\sum_i^{n}  
 m_i \vert {r}_i -{r}_{\rm COM} \vert ^2 }{\sum_i^{n} m_i} \Big)^{1/2} 
\f]

with the position of the center of mass \f${r}_{\rm COM}\f$ given by:

\f[
{r}_{\rm COM}=\frac{\sum_i^{n} {r}_i\ m_i }{\sum_i^{n} m_i}
\f]


\par Examples

The following input tells plumed to print the radius of gyration of the 
chain containing atoms 10 to 20.
\verbatim
GYRATION TYPE=RADIUS ATOMS=10-20 LABEL=rg
PRINT ARG=rg STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar 
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT)
