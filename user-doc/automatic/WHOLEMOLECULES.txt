This action is used to rebuild molecules that can become split by the periodic
boundary conditions.

It is similar to the ALIGN_ATOMS keyword of plumed1, and is needed since some
MD dynamics code (e.g. GROMACS) can break molecules during the calculation.

Running some CVs without this command can cause there to be discontinuities changes
in the CV value and artifacts in the calculations.  This command can be applied
more than once.  To see what effect is has use a variable without pbc or use
the \ref DUMPATOMS directive to output the atomic positions.

\attention
This directive modifies the stored position at the precise moment
it is executed. This means that only collective variables
which are below it in the input script will see the corrected positions.
As a general rule, put it at the top of the input file. Also, unless you
know exactly what you are doing, leave the default stride (1), so that
this action is performed at every MD step.

\par The atoms involved can be specified using

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ENTITY </b></td>
<td> the atoms that make up a molecule that you wish to align. To specify multiple molecules use a list of ENTITY keywords: ENTITY1, ENTITY2,... You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. ENTITY1, ENTITY2, ENTITY3... </td>
</tr>
</table>

\par Or alternatively by using

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> RESIDUES </b></td>
<td> this command specifies a set of residues which all must be aligned. It must be used in tandem with the \ref MOLINFO action and the RES_ATOMS keyword. If you wish to use all the residues from all the chains in your system you can do so by specifying all. Alternatively, if you wish to use a subset of the residues you can specify the particular residues you are interested in as a list of numbers </td>
</tr>
</table>

\par Compulsory keywords

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> STRIDE </b></td>
<td> ( default=1 ) the frequency with which molecules are reassembled.  Unless you are completely certain about what you are doing leave this set equal to 1! </td>
</tr>
</table>

</table>

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> RES_ATOMS </b></td>
<td> this command tells plumed what atoms should be aligned in each of the residues that are being aligned </td>
</tr>

\par Examples

This command instructs plumed to reconstruct the molecule containing atoms 1-20
at every step of the calculation and dump them on a file.

\verbatim
# to see the effect, one could dump the atoms as they were before molecule reconstruction:
# DUMPATOMS FILE=dump-broken.xyz ATOMS=1-20
WHOLEMOLECULES STRIDE=1 ENTITY0=1-20
DUMPATOMS FILE=dump.xyz ATOMS=1-20
\endverbatim
(see also \ref DUMPATOMS)

This command instructs plumed to reconstruct two molecules containing atoms 1-20 and 30-40

\verbatim
WHOLEMOLECULES STRIDE=1 ENTITY0=1-20 ENTITY1=30-40
DUMPATOMS FILE=dump.xyz ATOMS=1-20,30-40
\endverbatim
(see also \ref DUMPATOMS)

This command instructs plumed to reconstruct the chain of backbone atoms in a
protein

\verbatim
MOLINFO REFERENCE=helix.pdb
WHOLEMOLECULES STRIDE=1 RESIDUES=ALL RES_ATOMS=N,CA,CB,C,O
\endverbatim
(See also \ref MOLINFO)
