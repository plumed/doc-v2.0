\page METAD METAD
Used to performed MetaDynamics on one or more collective variables.

In a metadynamics simulations a history dependent bias composed of
intermittently added Gaussian functions is added to the potential \cite metad.

\f[
V(\vec{s},t) = \sum_{ k \tau < t} W(k \tau)
\exp\left(
-\sum_{i=1}^{d} \frac{(s_i-s_i^{(0)}(k \tau))^2}{2\sigma_i^2}
\right).
\f]

This potential forces the system away from the kinetic traps in the potential energy surface
and out into the unexplored parts of the energy landscape. Information on the Gaussian
functions from which this potential is composed is output to a file called HILLS, which
is used both the restart the calculation and to reconstruct the free energy as a function of the CVs.
The free energy can be reconstructed from a metadynamics calculation because the final bias is given
by:

\f[
V(\vec{s}) = -F(\vec(s))
\f]

During post processing the free energy can be calculated in this way using the \ref sum_hills
utility.

In the simplest possible implementation of a metadynamics calculation the expense of a metadynamics
calculation increases with the length of the simulation as one has to, at every step, evaluate
the values of a larger and larger number of Gaussians. To avoid this issue you can in plumed 2.0
store the bias on a grid.  This approach is similar to that proposed in \cite babi+08jcp but has the
advantage that the grid spacing is independent on the Gaussian width.

Another option that is available in plumed 2.0 is well-tempered metadynamics \cite Barducci:2008. In this
varient of metadynamics the heights of the Gaussian hills are rescaled at each step so the bias is now
given by:

\f[
V({s},t)= \sum_{t'=0,\tau_G,2\tau_G,\dots}^{t'<t} W e^{-V({s}({q}(t'),t')/\Delta T} \exp\left(
-\sum_{i=1}^{d} \frac{(s_i({q})-s_i({q}(t'))^2}{2\sigma_i^2}
\right),
\f]

This method ensures that the bias converges more smoothly.

Note that you can use here also the flexible gaussian approach  \cite Branduardi:2012dl
in which you can adapt the gaussian to the extent of Cartesian space covered by a variable or
to the space in collective variable covered in a given time. In this case the width of the deposited
gaussian potential is denoted by one value only that is a Cartesian space (ADAPTIVE=GEOM) or a time
(ADAPTIVE=DIFF). Note that a specific integration technique for the deposited gaussians
should be used in this case. Check the documentation for utility sum_hills.

With the keyword INTERVAL one changes the metadynamics algorithm setting the bias force equal to zero
outside boundary \cite baftizadeh2012protein. If, for example, metadynamics is performed on a CV s and one is interested only
to the free energy for s > sw, the history dependent potential is still updated according to the above
equations but the metadynamics force is set to zero for s < sw. Notice that Gaussians are added also
if s < sw, as the tails of these Gaussians influence VG in the relevant region s > sw. In this way, the
force on the system in the region s > sw comes from both metadynamics and the force field, in the region
s < sw only from the latter. This approach allows obtaining a history-dependent bias potential VG that
fluctuates around a stable estimator, equal to the negative of the free energy far enough from the
boundaries. Note that:
- It works only for one-dimensional biases;
- It works with GRID but automatically turn off the SPLINES so set a higher number of BINS;
- The interval limit sw in a region where the free energy derivative is not large;
- If in the region outside the limit sw the system has a free energy minimum, the INTERVAL keyword should
be used together with a soft wall at sw

Multiple walkers  \cite multiplewalkers can also be used. See below the examples.

<td> the input for this action is the output from one or more other actions. The particular output that you used is referenced using that action of interests label. If the label appears on its own then the value of the relevant Action is taken.  If * or *.* appears the information from all arguments is taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs, each component of the output has a specific label so for instance an action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.* </td>

\par Examples
The following input is for a standard metadynamics calculation using as
collective variables the distance between atoms 3 and 5
and the distance between atoms 2 and 4. The value of the CVs and
the metadynamics bias potential are written to the COLVAR file every 100 steps.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
METAD ARG=d1,d2 SIGMA=0.2,0.2 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500 LABEL=restraint
PRINT ARG=d1,d2,restraint.bias STRIDE=100  FILE=COLVAR
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE \ref PRINT).

\par
If you use adaptive Gaussians, with diffusion scheme where you use
a Gaussian that should cover the space of 20 timesteps in collective variables.
Note that in this case the histogram correction is needed when summing up hills.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
METAD ARG=d1,d2 SIGMA=20 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500 LABEL=restraint ADAPTIVE=DIFF
PRINT ARG=d1,d2,restraint.bias STRIDE=100  FILE=COLVAR
\endverbatim

\par
If you use adaptive Gaussians, with geometrical scheme where you use
a Gaussian that should cover the space of 0.05 nm in Cartesian space.
Note that in this case the histogram correction is needed when summing up hills.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
METAD ARG=d1,d2 SIGMA=0.05 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500 LABEL=restraint ADAPTIVE=GEOM
PRINT ARG=d1,d2,restraint.bias STRIDE=100  FILE=COLVAR
\endverbatim

\par
When using adaptive Gaussians you might want to limit how the hills width can change.
You can use SIGMA_MIN and SIGMA_MAX keywords.
The sigmas should specified in terms of CV so you should use the CV units.
Note that if you use a negative number, this means that the limit is not set.
Note also that in this case the histogram correction is needed when summing up hills.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
METAD ...
ARG=d1,d2 SIGMA=0.05 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500 LABEL=restraint ADAPTIVE=GEOM
SIGMA_MIN=0.2,0.1 SIGMA_MAX=0.5,1.0
... METAD
PRINT ARG=d1,d2,restraint.bias STRIDE=100  FILE=COLVAR
\endverbatim


\par
Multiple walkers can be also use as in  \cite multiplewalkers
These are enabled by setting the number of walker used, the id of the
current walker which interprets the input file, the directory where the
hills containing files resides, and the frequency to read the other walkers.
Here is an example
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
METAD ...
ARG=d1 SIGMA=0.05 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500 LABEL=restraint
WALKERS_N=10
WALKERS_ID=3
WALKERS_DIR=../
WALKERS_RSTRIDE=100
... METAD
\endverbatim
where  WALKERS_N is the total number of walkers, WALKERS_ID is the
id of the present walker (starting from 0 ) and the WALKERS_DIR is the directory
where all the walkers are located. WALKERS_RSTRIDE is the number of step between
one update and the other.
