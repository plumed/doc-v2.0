This action is used to rebuild molecules that can become split by the periodic
boundary conditions.

It is similar to the ALIGN_ATOMS keyword of plumed1, and is needed since some
MD dynamics code (e.g. GROMACS) can break molecules during the calculation.

Running some CVs without this command can cause there to be discontinuities changes
in the CV value and artifacts in the calculations.  This command can be applied 
more than once.  To see what effect is has use a variable without pbc or use
the \ref DUMPATOMS directive to output the atomic positions.

\attention
This directive modifies the stored position at the precise moment
it is executed. This means that only collective variables
which are below it in the input script will see the corrected positions.
As a general rule, put it at the top of the input file. Also, unless you
know exactly what you are doing, leave the default stride (1), so that
this action is performed at every MD step.

\par Examples

This command instructs plumed to reconstruct the molecule containing atoms 1-20
at every step of the calculation and dump them on a file.

\verbatim
# to see the effect, one could dump the atoms as they were before molecule reconstruction:
# DUMPATOMS FILE=dump-broken.xyz ATOMS=1-20
WHOLEMOLECULES STRIDE=1 ENTITY0=1-20
DUMPATOMS FILE=dump.xyz ATOMS=1-20
\endverbatim
(see also \ref DUMPATOMS)

This command instructs plumed to reconstruct two molecules containing atoms 1-20 and 30-40

\verbatim
WHOLEMOLECULES STRIDE=1 ENTITY0=1-20 ENTITY1=30-40
DUMPATOMS FILE=dump.xyz ATOMS=1-20,30-40
\endverbatim
(see also \ref DUMPATOMS)

This command instructs plumed to reconstruct the chain of backbone atoms in a 
protein

\verbatim
MOLINFO REFERENCE=helix.pdb
WHOLEMOLECULES STRIDE=1 RESIDUES=ALL RES_ATOMS=N,CA,CB,C,O
\endverbatim
(See also \ref MOLINFO)
