/**
\page UPPER_WALLS UPPER_WALLS
The LOWER_WALLS and UPPER_WALLS keywords define a wall for the value of one or more collective variables,
 which limits the region of the phase space accessible during the simulation. 

The restraining potential starts acting on the system when the value of the CV is greater 
(in the case of UPPER_WALLS) or lower (in the case of LOWER_WALLS) than a certain limit \f$a_i\f$ (AT) 
minus an offset \f$o_i\f$ (OFFSET).
The expression for the bias due to the wall is given by:

\f$
  \sum_i {k_i}((x_i-a_i+o_i)/s_i)^e_i
\f$

\f$k_i\f$ (KAPPA) is an energy constant in internal unit of the code, \f$s_i\f$ (EPS) a rescaling factor and 
\f$e_i\f$ (EXP) the exponent determining the power law. By default: EXP = 2, EPS = 1.0, OFF = 0.


\par Examples
The following input tells plumed to add both a lower and an upper walls on the distance 
between atoms 3 and 5 and the distance between atoms 2 and 4. The lower and upper limits
are defined at different values. The strength of the walls is the same for the four cases. 
It also tells plumed to print the energy of the walls. 
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
UPPER_WALLS ARG=d1,d2 AT=1.0,1.5 KAPPA=150.0,150.0 EXP=2,2 EPS=1,1 OFFSET 0,0 LABEL=uwall
LOWER_WALLS ARG=d1,d2 AT=0.0,1.0 KAPPA=150.0,150.0 EXP=2,2 EPS=1,1 OFFSET 0,0 LABEL=lwall
PRINT ARG=uwall.bias,lwall.bias
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).
