<td> ( default=1 ) the frequency with which the file should be read. </td>

<td width=15%> <b> EVERY </b></td>
<td> ( default=1 ) only read every ith line of the colvar file. This should be used if the colvar was written more frequently than the trajectory. </td>

\par Examples

This input reads in data from a file called input_colvar.data that was generated
in a calculation that involved PLUMED.  The first command reads in the data from the
column headed phi1 while the second reads in the data from the column headed phi2.

\verbatim
rphi1:       READ FILE=input_colvar.data  VALUES=phi1
rphi2:       READ FILE=input_colvar.data  VALUES=phi2
PRINT ARG=rphi1,rphi2 STRIDE=500  FILE=output_colvar.data
\endverbatim
