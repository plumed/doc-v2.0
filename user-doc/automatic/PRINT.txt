/**
\page PRINT PRINT
Print quantities to a file.

This directive can be used multiple times
in the input so you can print files with different strides or print different quantities
to different files.  You can control the buffering of output using the \subpage FLUSH keyword.

\par Compulsory keywords

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ARG </b></td>
<td> the input for this action is the output from one or more other actions. The particular output that you used is referenced using that action of interests label. If the label appears on its own then the value of the relevant Action is taken.  If * or *.* appears the information from all arguments is taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs, each component of the output has a specific label so for instance an action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.* </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> STRIDE </b></td>
<td> ( default=1 ) the frequency with which the quantities of interest should be output </td>
</tr>

<td width=15%> <b> FILE </b></td>

\par Examples
The following input instructs plumed to print the distance between atoms 3 and 5 on a file
called COLVAR every 10 steps, and the distance and total energy on a file called COLVAR_ALL
every 1000 steps.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,5 LABEL=distance
ENERGY             LABEL=energy
PRINT ARG=distance          STRIDE=10   FILE=COLVAR
PRINT ARG=distance,energy   STRIDE=1000 FILE=COLVAR_ALL
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref ENERGY).
