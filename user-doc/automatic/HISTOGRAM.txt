<td> the input for this action is the output from one or more other actions. The particular output that you used is referenced using that action of interests label. If the label appears on its own then the value of the relevant Action is taken.  If * or *.* appears the information from all arguments is taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs, each component of the output has a specific label so for instance an action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.* </td>

\par Examples

The following input monitors two torsional angles during a simulation
and outputs a histogram as a function of them at the end of the simulation.
\verbatim
TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4 LABEL=r1
TORSION ATOMS=2,3,4,5 LABEL=r2
HISTOGRAM ...
ARG=r1,r2

GRID_MAX=3.14,3.14
GRID_BIN=200,200
BANDWIDTH=0.05,0.05
GRID_WFILE=histo
... HISTOGRAM
\endverbatim

The following input monitors two torsional angles during a simulation
and outputs the histogram accumulated thus far every 100000 steps.
\verbatim
