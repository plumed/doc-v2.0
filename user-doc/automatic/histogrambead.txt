If we have multiple instances of a variable we can estimate the probability distribution (pdf)
for that variable using a process called kernel density estimation:

\f[
P(s) = \sum_i K\left( \frac{s - s_i}{w} \right)
\f] 

In this equation \f$K\f$ is a symmetric funciton that must integrate to one that is often
called a kernel function and \f$w\f$ is a smearing parameter.  From a pdf calculated using 
kernel density estimation we can calculate the number/fraction of values between an upper and lower
bound using:

\f[
w(s) = \int_a^b \sum_i K\left( \frac{s - s_i}{w} \right)
\f]     

All the input to calculate a quantity like \f$w(s)\f$ is generally provided through a single 
keyword that will have the following form:

KEYWORD={TYPE UPPER=\f$a\f$ LOWER=\f$b\f$ SMEAR=\f$\frac{w}{b-a}\f$}

This will calculate the number of values between \f$a\f$ and \f$b\f$.  To calculate
the fraction of values you add the word NORM to the input specification.  If the 
function keyword SMEAR is not present \f$w\f$ is set equal to \f$0.5(b-a)\f$. Finally,
type should specify one of the kernel types that is present in plumed. These are listed
in the table below:

<table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%>
<tr> 
<td> TYPE </td> <td> FUNCTION </td> 
</tr> <tr> 
<td> GAUSSIAN </td> <td> \f$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}w} \exp\left( -\frac{(s-s_i)^2}{2w^2} \right)\f$ </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td> TRIANGULAR </td> <td> \f$ \frac{1}{2w} \left( 1. - \left| \frac{s-s_i}{w} \right| \right) \quad \frac{s-s_i}{w}<1 \f$ </td>
</tr>
</table>

Some keywords can also be used to calculate a descretized version of the histogram.  That
is to say the number of values between \f$a\f$ and \f$b\f$, the number of values between
\f$b\f$ and \f$c\f$ and so on.  A keyword that specifies this sort of calculation would look
something like

KEYWORD={TYPE UPPER=\f$a\f$ LOWER=\f$b\f$ NBINS=\f$n\f$ SMEAR=\f$\frac{w}{n(b-a)}\f$}
 
This specification would calculate the following vector of quantities: 

\f[
w_j(s) = \int_{a + \frac{j-1}{n}(b-a)}^{a + \frac{j}{n}(b-a)} \sum_i K\left( \frac{s - s_i}{w} \right) 
\f]
