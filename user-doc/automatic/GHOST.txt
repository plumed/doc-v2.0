/**
\page GHOST GHOST
Calculate the absolute position of a ghost atom with fixed coordinates
in the local reference frame formed by three atoms.
The computed ghost atom is stored as a virtual atom that can be accessed in
an atom list through the the label for the GHOST action that creates it.

\par The atoms involved can be specified using

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ATOMS </b></td>
<td> the list of atoms which are involved the virtual atom's definition </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> COORDINATES </b></td>
<td> coordinates of the ghost atom in the local reference frame </td>
</tr>
</table>

</table>

</table>

\par Examples
The following input instructs plumed to print the distance between the
ghost atom and the center of mass for atoms 15,20:
\verbatim
GHOST ATOMS=1,5,10 COORDINATES=10.0,10.0,10.0 LABEL=c1
COM ATOMS=15,20       LABEL=c2
DISTANCE ATOMS=c1,c2  LABEL=d1
PRINT ARG=d1
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).

\warning If a force is added to a ghost atom, the contribution
to the virial could contain small artifacts. It is therefore discouraged to
use GHOST in a constant pressure simulation.
