Probe the antiparallel beta sheet content of your protein structure.

Two protein segments containing three continguous residues can form an antiparallel beta sheet. 
Although if the two segments are part of the same protein chain they must be separated by 
a minimum of 2 residues to make room for the turn. This colvar thus generates the set of 
all possible six residue sections that could conceivably form an antiparallel beta sheet 
and calculates the RMSD distance between the configuration in which the residues find themselves
and an idealized antiparallel beta sheet structure. These distances can be calculated by either 
aligning the instantaneous structure with the reference structure and measuring each
atomic displacement or by calculating differences between the set of interatomic
distances in the reference and instantaneous structures. 

This colvar is based on the following reference \cite pietrucci09jctc.  The authors of 
this paper use the set of distances from the anti parallel beta sheet configurations to measure 
the number of segments that have an configuration that resemebles an anti paralel beta sheet. This is done by calculating
the following sum of functions of the rmsd distances:

\f[
s = \sum_i \frac{ 1 - \left(\frac{r_i-d_0}{r_0}\right)^n } { 1 - \left(\frac{r_i-d_0}{r_0}\right)^m }
\f]

where the sum runs over all possible segments of antiparallel beta sheet.  By default the 
NN, MM and D_0 parameters are set equal to those used in \cite pietrucci09jctc.  The R_0
parameter must be set by the user - the value used in \cite pietrucci09jctc was 0.08 nm.

If you change the function in the above sum you can calculate quantities such as the average
distance from a purely configuration composed of pure anti-parallel beta sheets or the distance between the set of 
residues that is closest to an anti-parallel beta sheet and the reference configuration. To do these sorts of 
calculations you can use the AVERAGE and MIN keywords. In addition you can use the LESS_THAN
keyword if you would like to change the form of the switching function. If you use any of these
options you no longer need to specify NN, R_0, MM and D_0.   

Please be aware that for codes like gromacs you must ensure that plumed 
reconstructs the chains involved in your CV when you calculate this CV using
anthing other than TYPE=DRMSD.  For more details as to how to do this see \ref WHOLEMOLECULES.
