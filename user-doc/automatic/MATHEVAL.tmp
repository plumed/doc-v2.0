/**
\page MATHEVAL MATHEVAL
Calculate a combination of variables using a matheval expression.

If you are using a time dependent expression you can get the time using
\subpage TIME   

\par Examples
The following input tells plumed to print the angle between vectors
identified by atoms 1,2 and atoms 2,3
its square (as computed from the x,y,z components) and the distance
again as computed from the square root of the square.
\verbatim
DISTANCE LABEL=d1 ATOMS=1,2 COMPONENTS
DISTANCE LABEL=d2 ATOMS=2,3 COMPONENTS
MATHEVAL ...
  LABEL=theta
  ARG=d1.x,d1.y,d1.z,d2.x,d2.y,d2.z
  VAR=ax,ay,az,bx,by,bz
  FUNC=acos((ax*bx+ay*by+az*bz)/sqrt((ax*ax+ay*ay+az*az)*(bx*bx+by*by+bz*bz))
... MATHEVAL
PRINT ARG=theta
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT and \ref DISTANCE).

\attention
The MATHEVAL object only works if libmatheval is installed on the system and
PLUMED has been linked to it
