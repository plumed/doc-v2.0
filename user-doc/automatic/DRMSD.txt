Calculate the distance RMSD with respect to a reference structure.

To calculate the root-mean-square deviation between the atoms in two configurations
you must first superimpose the two structures in some ways.  Obviously, it is the internal vibrational
motions of the structure - i.e. not the translations and rotations - that are interesting. However,
aligning two structures by removing the translational and rotational motions is not easy.  Furthermore,
in some cases there can be alignment issues caused by so-called frame-fitting problems. It is thus
often cheaper and easier to calculate the distances between all the pairs of atoms.  The distance
between the two structures, \f$\mathbf{X}^a\f$ and \f$\mathbf{X}^b\f$ can then be measured as:

\f[
d(\mathbf{X}^A, \mathbf{X}^B) = \frac{1}{N(N-1)} \sum_{i \ne j} [ d(\mathbf{x}_i^a,\mathbf{x}_j^a) - d(\mathbf{x}_i^b,\mathbf{x}_j^b) ]^2
\f]

where \f$N\f$ is the number of atoms and \f$d(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j)\f$ represents the distance between
atoms \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$.  Clearly, this representation of the configuration is invariant to translation and rotation.
However, it can become expensive to calculate when the number of atoms is large.  This can be resolved
within the DRMSD colvar by setting LOWER_CUTOFF and UPPER_CUTOFF.  These keywords ensure that only
pairs of atoms that are within a certain range are incorporated into the above sum.

In PDB files the atomic coordinates and box lengths should be in Angstroms unless
you are working with natural units.  If you are working with natural units then the coordinates
should be in your natural length unit.  For more details on the PDB file format visit http://www.wwpdb.org/docs.html

\par Examples

The following tells plumed to calculate the distance RMSD between
the positions of the atoms in the reference file and their instantaneous
position. Only pairs of atoms whose distance in the reference structure is within
0.1 and 0.8 nm are considered.
