/**
\page RANDOM_EXCHANGES RANDOM_EXCHANGES
Set random pattern for exchanges.

In this way, exchanges will not be done between replicas with consecutive index, but
will be done using a random pattern.  Typically used in bias exchange \cite piana.

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> SEED </b></td>
<td> seed for random exchanges </td>

\par Examples

Using the following three input files one can run a bias exchange
metadynamics simulation using a different angle in each replica.
Exchanges will be randomly tried between replicas 0-1, 0-2 and 1-2

Here is plumed.dat.0
\verbatim
RANDOM_EXCHANGES
t: TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
METAD ARG=t HEIGHT=0.1 PACE=100 SIGMA=0.3
\endverbatim

Here is plumed.dat.1
\verbatim
RANDOM_EXCHANGES
t: TORSION ATOMS=2,3,4,5
METAD ARG=t HEIGHT=0.1 PACE=100 SIGMA=0.3
\endverbatim

Here is plumed.dat.2
\verbatim
RANDOM_EXCHANGES
t: TORSION ATOMS=3,4,5,6
METAD ARG=t HEIGHT=0.1 PACE=100 SIGMA=0.3
\endverbatim

\warning Multi replica simulations are presently only working with gromacs.

\warning The directive should appear in input files for every replicas. In case SEED is specified, it
should be the same in all input files.
