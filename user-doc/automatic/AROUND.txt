\page AROUND AROUND
This quantity can be used to calculate functions of the distribution of collective
variables for the atoms that lie in a particular, user-specified part of of the cell.

Each of the base quantities calculated by a multicolvar can can be assigned to a particular point in three
dimensional space. For example, if we have the coordination numbers for all the atoms in the
system each coordination number can be assumed to lie on the position of the central atom.
Because each base quantity can be assigned to a particular point in space we can calculate functions of the
distribution of base quantities in a particular part of the box by using:

\f[
\overline{s}_{\tau} = \frac{ \sum_i f(s_i) w(x_i,y_i,z_i) }{ \sum_i w(x_i,y_i,z_i) }
\f]

where the sum is over the collective variables, \f$s_i\f$, each of which can be thought to be at \f$ (x_i,y_i,z_i)\f$.
The function \f$ w(x_i,y_i,z_i) \f$ measures whether or not the system is in the subregion of interest. It
is equal to:

\f[
w(x_i,y_i,z_i) = \int_{xl}^{xu} \int_{yl}^{yu} \int_{zl}^{zu} \textrm{d}x\textrm{d}y\textrm{d}z K\left( \frac{x - x_i}{\sigma} \right)K\left( \frac{y - y_i}{\sigma} \right)K\left( \frac{z - z_i}{\sigma} \right)
\f]

where \f$K\f$ is one of the kernel functions described on \ref histogrambead and \f$\sigma\f$ is a bandwidth parameter.
The function \f$(s_i)\f$ can be any of the usual LESS_THAN, MORE_THAN, WITHIN etc that are used in all other multicolvars.

When AROUND is used with the \ref DENSITY action the number of atoms in the specified region is calculated

\par Description of components

This Action can be used to calculate the following quantities by employing the keywords listed below. You must select which from amongst these quantities you wish to calculate - this command cannot be run unless one of the quantities below is being calculated.These quantities can then be referenced elsewhere in the input file by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity. Some amongst them can be calculated multiple times with different parameters.  In this case the quantities calculated can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using the name of the quantity followed by a numerical identifier e.g. <em>label</em>.less_than-1, <em>label</em>.less_than-2 etc.
