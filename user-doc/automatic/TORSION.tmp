/**
\page TORSION TORSION
Calculate a torsional angle.

This command can be used to compute the torsion between four atoms or alternatively
to calculate the angle between two vectors projected on the plane
orthogonal to an axis. 

\par Examples

This input tells plumed to print the torsional angle between atoms 1, 2, 3 and 4
on file COLVAR.
\verbatim
t: TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
# this is an alternative, equivalent, definition:
# t: TORSION VECTOR1=2,1 AXIS=2,3 VECTOR2=3,4
PRINT ARG=t FILE=COLVAR
\endverbatim
