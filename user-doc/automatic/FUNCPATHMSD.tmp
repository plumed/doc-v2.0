/**
\page FUNCPATHMSD FUNCPATHMSD
This function calculates path collective variables. 

This is the Path Collective Variables implementation 
( see \cite brand07 ).
This variable computes the progress along a given set of frames that is provided  
in input ("s" component) and the distance from them ("z" component). 
It is a function of MSD that are obtained by the joint use of MSD variable and SQUARED flag 
(see below).

\par Examples

Here below is a case where you have defined three frames and you want to  
calculate the progress alng the path and the distance from it in p1

\verbatim
t1: RMSD REFERENCE=frame_1.dat TYPE=OPTIMAL SQUARED
t2: RMSD REFERENCE=frame_21.dat TYPE=OPTIMAL SQUARED
t3: RMSD REFERENCE=frame_42.dat TYPE=OPTIMAL SQUARED
p1: FUNCPATHMSD ARG=t1,t2,t3 LAMBDA=500.0 
PRINT ARG=t1,t2,t3,p1.s,p1.z STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar FMT=%8.4f
\endverbatim
