/**
\page ANGLE ANGLE
Calculate an angle.

This command can be used to compute the angle between three atoms. Alternatively
if four atoms appear in the atom
specification it calculates the angle between
two vectors identified by two pairs of atoms.

If _three_ atoms are given, the angle is defined as:
\f[
\theta=\arccos\left(\frac{ {\bf r}_{21}\cdot {\bf r}_{23}}{
|{\bf r}_{21}| |{\bf r}_{23}|}\right)
\f]
Here \f$ {\bf r}_{ij}\f$ is the distance vector among the
i-th and the j-th listed atom.

If _four_ atoms are given, the angle is defined as:
\f[
\theta=\arccos\left(\frac{ {\bf r}_{21}\cdot {\bf r}_{34}}{
|{\bf r}_{21}| |{\bf r}_{34}|}\right)
\f]

Notice that angles defined in this way are non-periodic variables and
their value is limited by definition between 0 and \f$\pi\f$.

The vectors \f$ {\bf r}_{ij}\f$ are by default evaluated taking
periodic boundary conditions into account.
This behavior can be changed with the NOPBC flag.

\par Examples

This command tells plumed to calculate the angle between the vector connecting atom 1 to atom 2 and
the vector connecting atom 2 to atom 3 and to print it on file COLVAR1. At the same time,
the angle between vector connecting atom 1 to atom 2 and the vector connecting atom 3 to atom 4 is printed
on file COLVAR2.
\verbatim

a: ANGLE ATOMS=1,2,3 
# equivalently one could state:
# a: ANGLE ATOMS=1,2,2,3

b: ANGLE ATOMS=1,2,3,4

PRINT ARG=a FILE=COLVAR1
PRINT ARG=b FILE=COLVAR2
\endverbatim
(see also \ref PRINT)
