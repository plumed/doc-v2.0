Calculate functions of the distribution of angles .

You can use this command to calculate functions such as:

\f[
f(x) = \sum_{ijk} g( \theta_{ijk} )
\f]

Alternatively you can use this command to calculate functions such as:

\f[
f(x) = \sum_{ijk} s(r_{ij})s(r_{jk}) g(\theta_{ijk})
\f]

where \f$s(r)\f$ is a \ref switchingfunction.  This second form means that you can
use this to calculate functions of the angles in the first coordination sphere of
an atom / molecule \cite lj-recon.

\par Description of components

This Action can be used to calculate the following quantities by employing the keywords listed below. You must select which from amongst these quantities you wish to calculate - this command cannot be run unless one of the quantities below is being calculated.These quantities can then be referenced elsewhere in the input file by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity. Some amongst them can be calculated multiple times with different parameters.  In this case the quantities calculated can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using the name of the quantity followed by a numerical identifier e.g. <em>label</em>.less_than-1, <em>label</em>.less_than-2 etc.

\par Examples

The following example instructs plumed to find the average of two angles and to
print it to a file

\verbatim
ANGLES ATOMS1=1,2,3 ATOMS2=4,5,6 MEAN LABEL=a1
PRINT ARG=a1.mean FILE=colvar
\endverbatim

The following example tells plumed to calculate all angles involving
at least one atom from GROUPA and two atoms from GROUPB in which the distances
are less than 1.0. The number of angles between \f$\frac{\pi}{4}\f$ and
\f$\frac{3\pi}{4}\f$ is then output

\verbatim
ANGLES GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=11-100 BETWEEN={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.25pi UPPER=0.75pi} SWITCH={GAUSSIAN R_0=1.0} LABEL=a1
PRINT ARG=a1.between FILE=colvar
\endverbatim

This final example instructs plumed to calculate all the angles in the first coordination
spheres of the atoms. A discretized-normalized histogram of the distribution is then output

\verbatim
ANGLES GROUP=1-38 HISTOGRAM={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.0 UPPER=pi NBINS=20} SWITCH={GAUSSIAN R_0=1.0} LABEL=a1
PRINT ARG=a1.* FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
