/**
\page READ READ
Read quantities from a colvar file.

This Action can be used with driver to read in a colvar file that was generated during 
an MD simulation

\par Description of components

The READ command will read those fields that are labelled with the text string given to the
VALUE keyword.  It will also read in any fields that are labelleled with the text string 
given to the VALUE keyword followed by a dot and a further string. If a single Value is read in
this value can be referenced using the label of the Action.  Alternatively, if multiple quanties
are read in, they can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using the label for the Action
followed by a dot and the character string that appeared after the dot in the title of the field.

\par Examples

This input reads in data from a file called input_colvar.data that was generated
in a calculation that involved PLUMED.  The first command reads in the data from the 
column headed phi1 while the second reads in the data from the column headed phi2.

\verbatim
rphi1:       READ FILE=input_colvar.data  VALUES=phi1
rphi2:       READ FILE=input_colvar.data  VALUES=phi2
PRINT ARG=rphi1,rphi2 STRIDE=500  FILE=output_colvar.data
\endverbatim
