/**

gentemplate is a tool that you can use to construct template inputs for the various
actions

The templates generated by this tool are primarily for use with Toni Giorgino's vmd gui.  It may be
useful however to use this tool as a quick aid memoir.

\par Examples

The following generates template input for the action DISTANCE.
\verbatim
plumed gentemplate --action DISTANCE
\endverbatim
