/**
\page DHENERGY DHENERGY
Calculate Debye-Huckel interaction energy among GROUPA and GROUPB.

This collective variable can be used to analyze or induce electrostatically driven reactions \cite do13jctc.
The two atom groups should be disjointed. Notice that the value of the DHENERGY is returned in plumed units (see \ref UNITS).

\par Examples
\verbatim
# this is printing the electrostatic interaction between two groups of atoms
dh: DHENERGY GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=11-20 EPSILON=80.0 I=0.1 TEMP=300.0
PRINT ARG=dh
\endverbatim
(see also \ref PRINT)
