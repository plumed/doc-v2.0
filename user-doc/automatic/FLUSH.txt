/**
\page FLUSH FLUSH
This command instructs plumed to flush all the open files with a user specified frequency.
Notice that all files are flushed anyway every 10000 steps.

This
is useful for preventing data loss that would otherwise arrise as a consequence of the code
storing data for printing in the buffers. Notice that wherever it is written in the
plumed input file, it will flush all the open files.

\verbatim
d1: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,10
PRINT ARG=d1 STRIDE=5 FILE=colvar1

FLUSH STRIDE=100

d2: DISTANCE ATOMS=2,11
# also this print is flushed every 100 steps:
PRINT ARG=d2 STRIDE=10 FILE=colvar2
\endverbatim
(see also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).
