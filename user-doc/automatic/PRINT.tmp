/**
\page PRINT PRINT
Print quantities to a file.

This directive can be used multiple times
in the input so you can print files with different strides or print different quantities 
to different files.  You can control the buffering of output using the \subpage FLUSH keyword.

\par Examples
The following input instructs plumed to print the distance between atoms 3 and 5 on a file 
called COLVAR every 10 steps, and the distance and total energy on a file called COLVAR_ALL
every 1000 steps.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,5 LABEL=distance
ENERGY             LABEL=energy
PRINT ARG=distance          STRIDE=10   FILE=COLVAR
PRINT ARG=distance,energy   STRIDE=1000 FILE=COLVAR_ALL
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref ENERGY).
