/**
\page UNITS UNITS
This command sets the internal units for the code.  A new unit can be set by either
specifying how to convert from the plumed default unit into that new unit or by using
the shortcuts described below.  This directive MUST appear at the BEGINNING of the 
plumed.dat file.  The same units must be used througout the plumed.dat file.

Notice that all input/output will then be made using the specified units.
That is: all the input parameters, all the output files, etc. The only
exceptions are file formats for which there is a specific convention concerning
the units. For example, trajectories written in .gro format (with \ref DUMPATOMS)
are going to be always in nm.

\par Examples
\verbatim
# this is using nm - kj/mol - fs
UNITS LENGTH=nm TIME=fs
\endverbatim
If a number, x, is found, the new unit is equal to x (default units)
\verbatim
# this is using nm - kj/mol - fs
UNITS LENGTH=nm TIME=0.001
\endverbatim
