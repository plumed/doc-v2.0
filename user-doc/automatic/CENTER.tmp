/**
\page CENTER CENTER
Calculate the center for a group of atoms, with arbitraty weights.

The computed
center is stored as a virtual atom that can be accessed in
an atom list through the label for the CENTER action that creates it.
Notice that the generated virtual atom has charge equal to the sum of the
charges and mass equal to the sum of the masses. If used with the MASS flag,
then it provides a result identical to \ref COM.

\par Examples

\verbatim
# a point which is on the line connecting atoms 1 and 10, so that its distance
# from 10 is twice its distance from 1:
c1: CENTER ATOMS=1,1,10
# this is another way of stating the same:
c1bis: CENTER ATOMS=1,10 WEIGHTS=2,1

# center of mass among these atoms:
c2: CENTER ATOMS=2,3,4,5 MASS

d1: DISTANCE ATOMS=c1,c2

PRINT ARG=d1
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE, \ref COM and \ref PRINT).
