/**
\page PATHMSD PATHMSD
This Colvar calculates path collective variables.

This is the Path Collective Variables implementation
( see \cite brand07 ).
This variable computes the progress along a given set of frames that is provided
in input ("sss" component) and the distance from them ("zzz" component).
(see below).

\par Description of components

By default this Action calculates the following quantities. These quanties can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr> <td width=5%> <b> Quantity </b> </td> <td> <b> Description </b> </td> </tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> sss </b></td>
<td> the position on the path </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> zzz </b></td>
<td> the distance from the path </td>
</tr>
</table>

\par Compulsory keywords

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> LAMBDA </b></td>
<td> the lambda parameter is needed for smoothing, is in the units of plumed </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> REFERENCE </b></td>
<td> the pdb is needed to provide the various milestones </td>
</tr>
</table>

\par Options

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES </b></td>
<td> ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these quantities numerically </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> NOPBC </b></td>
<td> ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions when calculating distances </td>
</tr>

</table>

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> NEIGH_SIZE </b></td>
<td> size of the neighbor list </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> NEIGH_STRIDE </b></td>
<td> how often the neighbor list needs to be calculated in time units </td>
</tr>

</table>

\par Examples

Here below is a case where you have defined three frames and you want to
calculate the progress along the path and the distance from it in p1

\verbatim
p1: PATHMSD REFERENCE=file.pdb  LAMBDA=500.0 NEIGH_STRIDE=4 NEIGH_SIZE=8
PRINT ARG=p1.sss,p1.zzz STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar FMT=%8.4f
\endverbatim

note that NEIGH_STRIDE=4 NEIGH_SIZE=8 control the neighborlist parameter (optional but
recommended for performance) and states that the neighbor list will be calculated every 4
timesteps and consider only the closest 8 member to the actual md snapshots.

\note
The implementation of this collective variable and of \ref PROPERTYMAP
is shared, as well as most input options.
