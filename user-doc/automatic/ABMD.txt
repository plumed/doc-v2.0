Adds a ratchet-and-pawl like restraint on one or more variables.

This action can be used to evolve a system towards a target value in
CV space using an harmonic potential moving with the thermal fluctuations of the CV
\cite ballone \cite provasi10abmd \cite camilloni11abmd. The biasing potential in this
method is as follows:

\f$
V(\rho(t)) = \left \{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{K}{2}\left(\rho(t)-\rho_m(t)\right)^2, &\rho(t)>\rho_m(t)\\
0, & \rho(t)\le\rho_m(t), \end{array} \right .
\f$


where


\f$
\rho(t)=\left(CV(t)-TO\right)^2
\f$


and


\f$
\rho_m(t)=\min_{0\le\tau\le t}\rho(\tau)+\eta(t)
\f$.

The method is based on the introduction of a biasing potential which is zero when
the system is moving towards the desired arrival point and which damps the
fluctuations when the system attempts to move in the opposite direction. As in the
case of the ratchet and pawl system, propelled by thermal motion of the solvent
molecules, the biasing potential does not exert work on the system. \f$\eta(t)\f$ is
an additional white noise acting on the minimum position of the bias.

\par Description of components

By default this Action calculates the following quantities. These quanties can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr> <td width=5%> <b> Quantity </b> </td> <td> <b> Description </b> </td> </tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> bias </b></td>
<td> the instantaneous value of the bias potential </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> force2 </b></td>
<td> the instantaneous value of the squared force due to this bias potential </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> min_ </b></td>
<td> one or multiple instances of this quantity will be refereceable elsewhere in the input file. These quantities will be named as min_# and the number of the argument to which they refer.These quantities tell the user the minimum value assumed by rho_m(t). </td>

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ARG </b></td>
<td> the input for this action is the output from one or more other actions. The particular output that you used is referenced using that action of interests label. If the label appears on its own then the value of the relevant Action is taken.  If * or *.* appears the information from all arguments is taken.  Some actions have multi-component outputs, each component of the output has a specific label so for instance an action labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z.  To take just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all three components then use dist.* </td>

\par Examples
The following input sets up two biases, one on the distance between atoms 3 and 5
and another on the distance between atoms 2 and 4. The two target values are defined
using TO and the two strength using KAPPA. The total energy of the bias is printed.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
ABMD ARG=d1,d2 TO=1.0,1.5 KAPPA=5.0,5.0 LABEL=abmd
PRINT ARG=abmd.bias,abmd.min_1,abmd.min_2
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).
