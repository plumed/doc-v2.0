\page DISTANCES DISTANCES
Calculate the distances between one or many pairs of atoms.  You can then calculate functions of the distribution of
distances such as the minimum, the number less than a certain quantity and so on. 

\par Examples

The following input tells plumed to calculate the distances between atoms 3 and 5 and between atoms 1 and 2 and to 
print the minimum for these two distances.
\verbatim
DISTANCES ATOMS1=3,5 ATOMS2=1,2 MIN={BETA=0.1} LABEL=d1
PRINT ARG=d1.min
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT).

The following input tells plumed to calculate the distances between atoms 3 and 5 and between atoms 1 and 2
and then to calculate the number of these distances that are less than 0.1 nm.  The number of distances
less than 0.1nm is then printed to a file.
\verbatim
DISTANCES ATOMS1=3,5 ATOMS2=1,2 LABEL=d1 LESS_THAN={RATIONAL R_0=0.1}
PRINT ARG=d1.lt0.1
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT \ref switchingfunction).

The following input tells plumed to calculate all the distances between atoms 1, 2 and 3 (i.e. the distances between atoms
1 and 2, atoms 1 and 3 and atoms 2 and 3).  The average of these distances is then calculated.
\verbatim
DISTANCES GROUP=1-3 AVERAGE LABEL=d1
PRINT ARG=d1.average
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT)

The following input tells plumed to calculate all the distances between the atoms in GROUPA and the atoms in GROUPB.
In other words the distances between atoms 1 and 2 and the distance between atoms 1 and 3.  The number of distances
more than 0.1 is then printed to a file.
\verbatim
DISTANCES GROUPA=1 GROUPB=2,3 MORE_THAN={RATIONAL R_0=0.1}
PRINT ARG=d1.gt0.1 
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT \ref switchingfunction)
