Calculate the number of atoms that bridge two parts of a structure
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  COORDINATIONNUMBER </td> <td>
Calculate the coordination numbers of atoms so that you can then calculate functions of the distribution of
coordination numbers such as the minimum, the number less than a certain quantity and so on.

<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  DENSITY </td> <td>
Calculate functions of the density of atoms as a function of the box.  This allows one to calculate
the number of atoms in half the box.

<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  DISTANCES </td> <td>
Calculate the distances between one or many pairs of atoms.  You can then calculate functions of the distribution of
distances such as the minimum, the number less than a certain quantity and so on.
