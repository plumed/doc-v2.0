Calculate coordination numbers.

This keyword can be used to calculate the coordination numbers for atoms in your system. 
We use the following switching function to make the coordination number differentiable:

\f[
s = \frac{ 1 - \left(\frac{r-d_0}{r_0}\right)^n } { 1 - \left(\frac{r-d_0}{r_0}\right)^m }
\f]

To make your calculation faster you can use a neighbor list, which makes it that only a
relevant subset of the pairwise distance are calculated at every step.

\par Examples

The following example instructs plumed to calculate the total coordination number of the atoms in group 1-10 with the atoms in group 20-100.  For atoms 1-10 coordination numbers are calculated that count the number of atoms from the second group that are within 0.3 nm of the central atom.  A neighbour list is used to make this calculation faster, this neighbour list is updated every 100 steps.
