Calculate coordination numbers.

This keyword can be used to calculate the number of contacts between two groups of atoms
and is defined as
\f[
\sum_{i\in A} \sum_{i\in B} s_{ij}
\f]
where \f$s_{ij}\f$ is 1 if the contact between atoms \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$ is formed,
zero otherwise.
In practise, \f$s_{ij}\f$ is replaced with a switching function to make it differentiable.
The default switching function is:
\f[
s_{ij} = \frac{ 1 - \left(\frac{{\bf r}_{ij}-d_0}{r_0}\right)^n } { 1 - \left(\frac{{\bf r}_{ij}-d_0}{r_0}\right)^m }
\f]
but it can be changed using the optional SWITCH option.

To make your calculation faster you can use a neighbor list, which makes it that only a
relevant subset of the pairwise distance are calculated at every step.

\par Examples

The following example instructs plumed to calculate the total coordination number of the atoms in group 1-10 with the atoms in group 20-100.  For atoms 1-10 coordination numbers are calculated that count the number of atoms from the second group that are within 0.3 nm of the central atom.  A neighbour list is used to make this calculation faster, this neighbour list is updated every 100 steps.
