\page DUMPDERIVATIVES DUMPDERIVATIVES
Dump the derivatives with respect to the input parameters for one or more objects (generally CVs, functions or biases).

For a CV this line in input instructs plumed to print the derivative of the CV with respect to the atom positions 
and the cell vectors (virial-like form).  In contrast, for a function or bias the derivative with respect to the input "CVs"
will be output.  This command is most often used to test whether or not analytic derivatives have been implemented correctly.  This
can be done by outputting the derivatives calculated analytically and numerically.  You can control the buffering of output using the \ref FLUSH keyword.

\par Examples
The following input instructs plumed to write a file called deriv that contains both the 
analytical and numerical derivatives of the distance between atoms 1 and 2.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOM=1,2 LABEL=distance
DISTANCE ATOM=1,2 LABEL=distanceN NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES
DUMPDERIVATIVES ARG=distance,distanceN STRIDE=1 FILE=deriv
\endverbatim

(See also \ref DISTANCE)
