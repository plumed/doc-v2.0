Calculate the probability density as a function of a few CVs using kernel density estimation

\par Examples

The following input monitors two torsional angles during a simulation
and outputs a histogram as a function of them at the end of the simulation.
\verbatim
TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4 LABEL=r1
TORSION ATOMS=2,3,4,5 LABEL=r2
HISTOGRAM ...
  ARG=r1,r2

  GRID_MIN=-3.14,-3.14 
  GRID_MAX=3.14,3.14 
  GRID_BIN=200,200
  BANDWIDTH=0.05,0.05

... HISTOGRAM
\endverbatim

The following input monitors two torsional angles during a simulation
and outputs the histogram accumulated thus far every 100000 steps.
\verbatim
TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4 LABEL=r1
TORSION ATOMS=2,3,4,5 LABEL=r2

\endverbatim

The following input monitors two torsional angles during a simulation
and outputs a separate histogram for each 100000 steps worth of trajectory.
