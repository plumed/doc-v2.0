\page COORDINATIONNUMBER COORDINATIONNUMBER
Calculate the coordination numbers of atoms so that you can then calculate functions of the distribution of
coordination numbers such as the minimum, the number less than a certain quantity and so on.   

To make the calculation of coordination numbers differentiable the following function is used:

\f[
s = \frac{ 1 - \left(\frac{r-d_0}{r_0}\right)^n } { 1 - \left(\frac{r-d_0}{r_0}\right)^m }
\f]

\par Examples

The following input tells plumed to calculate the coordination numbers of atoms 1-100 with themselves.
The minimum coordination number is then calculated.
\verbatim
COORDINATIONNUMBER SPECIES=1-100 R_0=1.0 MIN={BETA=0.1}
\endverbatim

The following input tells plumed to calculate how many atoms from 1-100 are within 3.0 of each of the atoms
from 101-110.  In the first 101 is the central atom, in the second 102 is the central atom and so on.  The 
number of coordination numbers more than 6 is then computed.
\verbatim
COORDINATIONNUMBER SPECIESA=101-110 SPECIESB=1-100 R_0=3.0 MORE_THAN={RATIONAL R_0=6.0 NN=6 MM=12 D_0=0}
\endverbatim
