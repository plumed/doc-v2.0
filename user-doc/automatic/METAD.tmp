\page METAD METAD
Used to performed MetaDynamics on one or more collective variables.

In a metadynamics simulations a history dependent bias composed of 
intermittently added Gaussian functions is added to the potential \cite metad.

\f[
V(\vec{s},t) = \sum_{ k \tau < t} W(k \tau)
\exp\left(
-\sum_{i=1}^{d} \frac{(s_i-s_i^{(0)}(k \tau))^2}{2\sigma_i^2}
\right).
\f]

This potential forces the system away from the kinetic traps in the potential energy surface
and out into the unexplored parts of the energy landscape. Information on the Gaussian
functions from which this potential is composed is output to a file called HILLS, which 
is used both the restart the calculation and to reconstruct the free energy as a function of the CVs. 
The free energy can be reconstructed from a metadynamics calculation because the final bias is given
by: 

\f[
V(\vec{s}) = -F(\vec(s))
\f]

During post processing the free energy can be calculated in this way using the \ref sum_hills
utility.

In the simplest possible implementation of a metadynamics calculation the expense of a metadynamics 
calculation increases with the length of the simulation as one has to, at every step, evaluate 
the values of a larger and larger number of Gaussians. To avoid this issue you can in plumed 2.0 
store the bias on a grid.  This approach is similar to that proposed in \cite babi+08jcp but has the 
advantage that the grid spacing is independent on the Gaussian width.

Another option that is available in plumed 2.0 is well-tempered metadynamics \cite Barducci:2008. In this
varient of metadynamics the heights of the Gaussian hills are rescaled at each step so the bias is now
given by:

\f[
V({s},t)= \sum_{t'=0,\tau_G,2\tau_G,\dots}^{t'<t} W e^{-V({s}({q}(t'),t')/\Delta T} \exp\left(
-\sum_{i=1}^{d} \frac{(s_i({q})-s_i({q}(t'))^2}{2\sigma_i^2}
\right),
\f]

This method ensures that the bias converges more smoothly. It should be noted that, in the case of well-tempered metadynamics, in
the output printed the Gaussian height is re-scaled using the bias factor.
Also notice that with well-tempered metadynamics the HILLS file does not contain the bias,
but the negative of the free-energy estimate. This choice has the advantage that
one can restart a simulation using a different value for the \f$\Delta T\f$. The applied bias will be scaled accordingly.

Note that you can use here also the flexible gaussian approach  \cite Branduardi:2012dl
in which you can adapt the gaussian to the extent of Cartesian space covered by a variable or
to the space in collective variable covered in a given time. In this case the width of the deposited
gaussian potential is denoted by one value only that is a Cartesian space (ADAPTIVE=GEOM) or a time
(ADAPTIVE=DIFF). Note that a specific integration technique for the deposited gaussians
should be used in this case. Check the documentation for utility sum_hills.

With the keyword INTERVAL one changes the metadynamics algorithm setting the bias force equal to zero 
outside boundary \cite baftizadeh2012protein. If, for example, metadynamics is performed on a CV s and one is interested only 
to the free energy for s > sw, the history dependent potential is still updated according to the above
equations but the metadynamics force is set to zero for s < sw. Notice that Gaussians are added also 
if s < sw, as the tails of these Gaussians influence VG in the relevant region s > sw. In this way, the 
force on the system in the region s > sw comes from both metadynamics and the force field, in the region 
s < sw only from the latter. This approach allows obtaining a history-dependent bias potential VG that 
fluctuates around a stable estimator, equal to the negative of the free energy far enough from the 
boundaries. Note that:
- It works only for one-dimensional biases;
- It works both with and without GRID;
- The interval limit sw in a region where the free energy derivative is not large;
- If in the region outside the limit sw the system has a free energy minimum, the INTERVAL keyword should 
  be used together with a soft wall at sw

As a final note, since version 2.0.2 when the system is outside of the selected interval the force
is set to zero and the bias value to the value at the corresponding boundary. This allows acceptances
for replica exchange methods to be computed correctly.

Multiple walkers  \cite multiplewalkers can also be used. See below the examples.

\par Examples
The following input is for a standard metadynamics calculation using as
collective variables the distance between atoms 3 and 5
and the distance between atoms 2 and 4. The value of the CVs and
the metadynamics bias potential are written to the COLVAR file every 100 steps.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
METAD ARG=d1,d2 SIGMA=0.2,0.2 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500 LABEL=restraint
PRINT ARG=d1,d2,restraint.bias STRIDE=100  FILE=COLVAR
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE \ref PRINT).

\par
If you use adaptive Gaussians, with diffusion scheme where you use
a Gaussian that should cover the space of 20 timesteps in collective variables.
Note that in this case the histogram correction is needed when summing up hills. 
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
METAD ARG=d1,d2 SIGMA=20 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500 LABEL=restraint ADAPTIVE=DIFF
PRINT ARG=d1,d2,restraint.bias STRIDE=100  FILE=COLVAR
\endverbatim

\par
If you use adaptive Gaussians, with geometrical scheme where you use
a Gaussian that should cover the space of 0.05 nm in Cartesian space.
Note that in this case the histogram correction is needed when summing up hills. 
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
METAD ARG=d1,d2 SIGMA=0.05 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500 LABEL=restraint ADAPTIVE=GEOM
PRINT ARG=d1,d2,restraint.bias STRIDE=100  FILE=COLVAR
\endverbatim

\par
When using adaptive Gaussians you might want to limit how the hills width can change. 
You can use SIGMA_MIN and SIGMA_MAX keywords.
The sigmas should specified in terms of CV so you should use the CV units. 
Note that if you use a negative number, this means that the limit is not set.
Note also that in this case the histogram correction is needed when summing up hills. 
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
METAD ...
  ARG=d1,d2 SIGMA=0.05 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500 LABEL=restraint ADAPTIVE=GEOM
  SIGMA_MIN=0.2,0.1 SIGMA_MAX=0.5,1.0	
... METAD 
PRINT ARG=d1,d2,restraint.bias STRIDE=100  FILE=COLVAR
\endverbatim


\par
Multiple walkers can be also use as in  \cite multiplewalkers 
These are enabled by setting the number of walker used, the id of the  
current walker which interprets the input file, the directory where the   
hills containing files resides, and the frequency to read the other walkers.
Here is an example
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
METAD ...
   ARG=d1 SIGMA=0.05 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500 LABEL=restraint 
   WALKERS_N=10
   WALKERS_ID=3
   WALKERS_DIR=../
   WALKERS_RSTRIDE=100
... METAD
\endverbatim
where  WALKERS_N is the total number of walkers, WALKERS_ID is the   
id of the present walker (starting from 0 ) and the WALKERS_DIR is the directory  
where all the walkers are located. WALKERS_RSTRIDE is the number of step between 
one update and the other.
