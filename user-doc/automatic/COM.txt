/**
\page COM COM
Calculate the center of mass for a group of atoms.

The computed
center of mass is stored as a virtual atom that can be accessed in
an atom list through the label for the COM action that creates it.

For arbitrary weights (e.g. geometric center) see \ref CENTER.

\par The atoms involved can be specified using

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ATOMS </b></td>
<td> the list of atoms which are involved the virtual atom's definition </td>
</tr>
</table>

</table>

</table>

\par Examples

The following input instructs plumed to print the distance between the
center of mass for atoms 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and that for atoms 15,20:
\verbatim
COM ATOMS=1-7         LABEL=c1
COM ATOMS=15,20       LABEL=c2
DISTANCE ATOMS=c1,c2  LABEL=d1
PRINT ARG=d1
\endverbatim
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).
