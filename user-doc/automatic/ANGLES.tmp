Calculate functions of the distribution of angles .

You can use this command to calculate functions such as:

\f[
 f(x) = \sum_{ijk} g( \theta_{ijk} )
\f] 

Alternatively you can use this command to calculate functions such as:

\f[
f(x) = \sum_{ijk} s(r_{ij})s(r_{jk}) g(\theta_{ijk})
\f]

where \f$s(r)\f$ is a \ref switchingfunction.  This second form means that you can
use this to calculate functions of the angles in the first coordination sphere of 
an atom / molecule \cite lj-recon.

\par Examples

The following example instructs plumed to find the average of two angles and to
print it to a file

\verbatim
ANGLES ATOMS=1,2,3 ATOMS=4,5,6 MEAN LABEL=a1
PRINT ARG=a1.mean FILE=colvar 
\endverbatim

The following example tells plumed to calculate all angles involving
at least one atom from GROUPA and two atoms from GROUPB in which the distances
are less than 1.0. The number of angles between \f$\frac{\pi}{4}\f$ and
\f$\frac{3\pi}{4}\f$ is then output  

\verbatim
ANGLES GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=11-100 BETWEEN={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.25pi UPPER=0.75pi} SWITCH={GAUSSIAN R_0=1.0} LABEL=a1
PRINT ARG=a1.between FILE=colvar
\endverbatim 

This final example instructs plumed to calculate all the angles in the first coordination
spheres of the atoms. A discretized-normalized histogram of the distribution is then output

\verbatim
ANGLE GROUP=1-38 HISTOGRAM={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.0 UPPER=pi NBINS=20} SWTICH={GAUSSIAN R_0=1.0} LABEL=a1
PRINT ARG=a1.* FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
