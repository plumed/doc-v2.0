<tr> <td width=5%> \subpage  FUNCSUMHILLS </td> <td>
This function is intended to be called by the command line tool sum_hills
and it is meant to integrate a HILLS file or an HILLS file interpreted as 
a histogram i a variety of ways. Therefore it is not expected that you use this 
during your dynamics (it will crash!)
