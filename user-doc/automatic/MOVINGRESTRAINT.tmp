\page MOVINGRESTRAINT MOVINGRESTRAINT
Add a time-dependent, harmonic restraint on one or more variables.

This form of bias can be used to performed steered MD \cite Grubmuller3
and Jarzynski sampling \cite jarzynski.

The harmonic restraint on your system is given by:

\f[
V(\vec{s},t) = \frac{1}{2} \kappa(t) ( \vec{s} - \vec{s}_0(t) )^2 
\f]

The time dependence of \f$\kappa\f$ and \f$\vec{s}_0\f$ are specified by a list of
STEP, KAPPA and AT keywords.  These keywords tell plumed what values \f$\kappa\f$ and \f$\vec{s}_0\f$
should have at the time specified by the corresponding STEP keyword.  Inbetween these times
the values of \f$\kappa\f$ and \f$\vec{s}_0\f$ are linearly interpolated.

\par Examples
The following input is dragging the distance between atoms 2 and 4
from 1 to 2 in the first 1000 steps, then back in the next 1000 steps.
In the following 500 steps the restraint is progressively switched off.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d
MOVINGRESTRAINT ...
  ARG=d
  STEP0=0    AT0=1.0 KAPPA0=100.0
  STEP1=1000 AT1=2.0
  STEP2=2000 AT2=1.0
  STEP3=2500         KAPPA3=0.0
... MOVINGRESTRAINT
\endverbatim
The following input is progressively building restraints
distances between atoms 1 and 5 and between atoms 2 and 4
in the first 1000 steps. Afterwards, the restraint is kept
static.
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=1,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 LABEL=d2
MOVINGRESTRAINT ...
  ARG=d1,d2 
  STEP0=0    AT0=1.0,1.5 KAPPA0=0.0,0.0
  STEP1=1000 AT1=1.0,1.5 KAPPA1=1.0,1.0
... MOVINGRESTRAINT
\endverbatim
The following input is progressively bringing atoms 1 and 2
close to each other with an upper wall
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2 LABEL=d1
MOVINGRESTRAINT ...
  ARG=d1
  VERSE=U
  STEP0=0    AT0=1.0 KAPPA0=10.0
  STEP1=1000 AT1=0.0
... MOVINGRESTRAINT
\endverbatim

By default the Action is issuing some values which are 
the work on each degree of freedom, the center of the harmonic potential,
the total bias deposited  

(See also \ref DISTANCE).

\attention Work is not computed properly when KAPPA is time dependent.
