/**
\page GROUP GROUP
Define a group of atoms so that a particular list of atoms can be referenced with a single label
in definitions of CVs or virtual atoms.

Notice that this command just creates a shortcut, and does not imply any real calculation.
It is just convenient to better organize input files. Might be used in combination with
the \ref INCLUDE command so as to store long group definitions in a separate file.

\par The atoms involved can be specified using

 <table align=center frame=void width=95%% cellpadding=5%%> 
<tr>
<td width=15%> <b> ATOMS </b></td>
<td> the numerical indexes for the set of atoms in the group </td>
</tr>
</table>

</table>

</table>

\par Examples

This command create a group of atoms containing atoms 1,4,7,11 and 14 (labeled 'o'), and another containing
atoms 2,3,5,6,8,9,12,13 (labeled 'h'):
\verbatim
o: GROUP ATOMS=1,4,7,11,14
h: GROUP ATOMS=2,3,5,6,8,9,12,13
# compute the coordination among the two groups
c: COORDINATION GROUPA=o GROUPB=h R_0=0.3
# same could have been obtained without GROUP, just writing:
# c: COORDINATION GROUPA=1,4,7,11,14 GROUPB=2,3,5,6,8,9,12,13

# print the coordination on file 'colvar'
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
(see also \ref COORDINATION and \ref PRINT)

Groups can be conveniently stored in a separate file.
E.g. one could create a file named 'groups.dat' which reads
\verbatim
o: GROUP ATOMS=1,4,7,11,14
h: GROUP ATOMS=2,3,5,6,8,9,12,13
\endverbatim
and then include it in the main 'plumed.dat' file
\verbatim
INCLUDE groups.dat
# compute the coordination among the two groups
c: COORDINATION GROUPA=o GROUPB=h R_0=0.3
# print the coordination on file 'colvar'
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
\endverbatim
(see also \ref INCLUDE, \ref COORDINATION, and \ref PRINT).
The groups.dat file could be very long and include lists of thousand atoms without cluttering the main plumed.dat file.
