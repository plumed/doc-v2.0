/**
\page PATHMSD PATHMSD
This Colvar calculates path collective variables. 

This is the Path Collective Variables implementation 
( see \cite brand07 ).
This variable computes the progress along a given set of frames that is provided  
in input ("sss" component) and the distance from them ("zzz" component). 
(see below).

\par Examples

Here below is a case where you have defined three frames and you want to  
calculate the progress along the path and the distance from it in p1

\verbatim
p1: PATHMSD REFERENCE=file.pdb  LAMBDA=500.0 NEIGH_STRIDE=4 NEIGH_SIZE=8 
PRINT ARG=p1.sss,p1.zzz STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar FMT=%8.4f
\endverbatim

note that NEIGH_STRIDE=4 NEIGH_SIZE=8 control the neighborlist parameter (optional but
recommended for performance) and states that the neighbor list will be calculated every 4
timesteps and consider only the closest 8 member to the actual md snapshots.

\note
The implementation of this collective variable and of \ref PROPERTYMAP
is shared, as well as most input options.
