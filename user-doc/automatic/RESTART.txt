Using the following input:
\verbatim
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=out
\endverbatim
a new 'out' file will be created. If an old one is on the way, it will be automatically backed up.
On the other hand, using the following input:
\verbatim
RESTART
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=out
\endverbatim
the file 'out' will be appended.
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).
