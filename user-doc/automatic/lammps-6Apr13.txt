PLUMED can be incorporated into LAMMPS using a simple patching procedure.
Patching must be done _before_ LAMMPS is configured.
After patching, one should enable PLUMED using the command
make yes-user-plumed
In the same way, before reverting one should disable PLUMED using the command
make no-user-plumed

Also notice that command "fix plumed" should be used in lammps input
file *after* the relevant input parameters have been set (e.g. after "timestep" command)

See also http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Section_commands.html for
further info on processing LAMMPS input, as well as
this discussion on github: http://github.com/plumed/plumed2/issues/67.
