PLUMED can be incorporated into gromacs using the standard patching procedure.
Patching must be done in the gromacs source directory  _after_ gromacs has been configured but  _before_ gromacs is compiled.
Gromcas should be configured with ./configure (not cmake).

To enable PLUMED in a gromacs simulation one should use
mdrun with an extra -plumed flag. The flag can be used to
specify the name of the PLUMED input file, e.g.:

mdrun -plumed plumed.dat
