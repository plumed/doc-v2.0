\page Bias Bias

Once you have calculated a number of collective variables PLUMED allows you to
run a number of enhanced sampling algorithms.
The list of available enhanced sampling algorithms contains: 

@BIAS@

Methods, such as \ref METAD, that introduce a history dependent bias can be restarted 
using the \subpage RESTART keyword

You can also use PLUMED in conjunction with VMD's interactive MD module by taking
advantage of the \subpage IMD action.
